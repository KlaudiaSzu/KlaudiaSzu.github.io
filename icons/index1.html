    <h1>Bee Diversity </h1>
    <p>To understand bees today, we need to learn about their origins and how they’ve changed over time. There are seven families of bees but I have chosen three which are described below.</p>


    <div class="row">
        <div class="family-col">
            <h3>Family Halictidae</h3>
            <p>bHelictidae is the second largest bee family, with almost 4,500 species.  Halictid bees aren’t usually picky about their pollen sources. This bee species, however, only harvests from the hedgenettle Stachys plant. Rophites algirus has a special method of extracting hedgenettle pollen: the bee places her head in the flower, then vibrates her flight muscles. Once the bee’s face is covered in pollen, she transfers it to her hind legs and flies it back to the nest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="family-col">
            <h3>Family Stenotritidae</h3>
            <p>There are only 21 species in the family Stenotritidae, making it the smallest of the seven bee families. Stenotritid bees are only found in Australia and have the most limited geographic range of any family. Their ground nests can reach depths of 10 feet! These bees are solitary ground nesters that have a preference for sandy habitats. This species has evolved to harvest from the dominant Australian plant family (Myrtaceae), including gum trees (Eucalyptus).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="family-col">
            <h3>Family Andrenidae</h3>
            <p>Andrenidae is a family with nearly 3,000 ground-nesting, solitary bee species. Many andrenid bees are adapted to harvest from a specific flowering plant. They live mostly in dry areas of western North America, South America, Europe, and Africa.Andrena crataegi emerges in the early spring. This bee pollinates fruit trees in the eastern United States. They’re especially good at pollinating apple trees.</p>

            <h3>WILDFLOWER HONEY</h3>
            <p>Wildflower honey features a select blend of wild blossoms and flowers. Because wildflower honey is collected from any variety of wildflowers depending on the season and region that they're in bloom, it may originate from any country that grows honey. Its taste varies depending on the flowers it is created from. However, it's typically slightly darker than other honey varieties, adding a robust flavor to baking recipes.</p>

        <div class="honey-col">
            <img src="images/buckweat.png">
            <h3>BUCKWHEAT HONEY</h3>
            <p>Dark and bold, buckwheat honey is collected fresh from the small white blossoms of the buckwheat grain. It's grown in the United States, France, Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands.Typically compared to blackstrap molasses, this honey variety is characterized by an earthy aroma and a rich amber color. It has a stronger and heartier taste than lighter honey varieties, and it's also higher in antioxidants. Because of its bold flavors, buckwheat honey is best used for baking and cooking. Products baked with this golden honey will dry out less quickly and be less likely to crack than those baked with traditional sugar.</p>

            <h3>CRANGE BLOSSOM HONEY</h3>
            <p>Fresh from the spring blossoms of Florida's orange groves, orange blossom honey features light citrus undertones. It has a golden color and a wholesome, sweet taste and aroma. The citrusy elements of orange blossom honey add an exciting element to baking endeavors. Try blending it with softened butter, orange rind, and lemon rind to create orange blossom honey butter, which is sure to become a popular menu item.</p>
